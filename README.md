# machine_Learning1.1
project 1.1 is a simple implementation of FIZZBUZZ program. Basic classification problem.
This project contains two versions of FIZZBUZZ program(please Refer to fizzbuzz problem from here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fizz-buzz-implementation/  before understanding the code).
Software 1.0 This approach of software design refers to the conventional style of programming in which the flow of program is controlled by the IF-ELSE statements. Software 1.0 involves processing by manipulation of stored input symbols using previously defined algorithms. For each input, the processing includes categorizing it into any one of the IF-ELSE block and generating the output specified in that code block.  This conventional programming technique has prevailed for over the last two decades. It involves constant evolution of the code i.e. if any characteristic (or feature) changes, all the programmer has to do is change the program according to new specification requirement. This dynamic somewhat changed with the introduction of machine learning. 
 
 The software 1.0 typically has the following algorithm: 1.  The code for a problem is written in a programming language. 2.  The program is then compiled using a compiler or interpreter (depends on the    language being used to code) which checks for any errors in the program. 3. Once the program is finished compiling without error, the interpreter converts the     code into low level machine language and then it is run. 
 
 Software 2.0 
 
Software 2.0 give rise to a contrast in the field of computer science where in the flow of the program does not depend on the code that a programmer writes rather it depends on multiple characteristics such as the training datasets provided to the program, number of hidden layers in the model, type of activation function used, type of loss function and the type of method to minimize the loss function, number of epochs etc.
